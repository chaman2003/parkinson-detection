# Excel Export Fixes - Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Added Tremor Frequency to Excel Report

**Problem:** Tremor Frequency was showing in the UI results page but missing from the Excel export

**Solution:** Added "Tremor Frequency" prominently in a new "KEY METRICS" section at the top of the tremor features

**Before:**
```
PATTERN FEATURES (0-100 scale)
Tremor Frequency Score | XX.XX%
Postural Stability Score | XX.XX%
...
[Tremor Frequency buried in FREQUENCY FEATURES section]
```

**After:**
```
KEY METRICS
Tremor Frequency | X.XX Hz  ← ✅ ADDED (actual Hz value)
Tremor Frequency Score | XX.XX%
Postural Stability Score | XX.XX%
...
```

Now users can see both:
- **Tremor Frequency** (Hz) - The actual measured frequency
- **Tremor Frequency Score** (%) - The pattern recognition score

---

### 2. ✅ Removed DFA Alpha

**Problem:** DFA Alpha was cluttering the Excel export and wasn't user-friendly

**Solution:** Removed DFA Alpha from STABILITY METRICS section

**Before:**
```
STABILITY METRICS
Stability Index | X.XXXX
Sample Entropy | X.XXXX
DFA Alpha | X.XXXX  ← ❌ REMOVED
```

**After:**
```
STABILITY METRICS
Stability Index | X.XXXX
Sample Entropy | X.XXXX
```

Cleaner and more focused on the key stability metrics users care about.

### 3. ✅ Fixed Audio Duration Showing Zero

**Problem:** Audio Duration field was showing "0.00 seconds" in Excel exports even when audio was recorded

**Root Cause:** The duration field wasn't being properly extracted from the backend response with adequate fallbacks

**Solution:** Enhanced the audio duration extraction with multiple fallback paths:

```javascript
// OLD - limited fallbacks
['Audio Duration', `${(voiceData.duration || results.metadata?.audio_duration || 0).toFixed(2)} seconds`]

// NEW - comprehensive fallbacks
['Audio Duration', `${(voiceData.duration || results.audio_features?.duration || results.metadata?.audio_duration || 0).toFixed(2)} seconds`]
```

**Fallback chain:**
1. Try `voiceData.duration` (prepared data)
2. Try `results.audio_features.duration` (raw backend features)
3. Try `results.metadata.audio_duration` (metadata)
4. Default to 0 if all fail

Now audio duration correctly shows values like "3.45 seconds" instead of "0.00 seconds"

---

### 4. ✅ Left-Aligned All Cell Values

**Problem:** Excel cell values were center or right-aligned by default, making the report harder to read

**Solution:** Applied left alignment to all cells in all sheets (Summary, Voice Features, Tremor Features)

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Apply left alignment to all cells
const range = XLSX.utils.decode_range(ws['!ref']);
for (let R = range.s.r; R <= range.e.r; ++R) {
    for (let C = range.s.c; C <= range.e.c; ++C) {
        const cellAddress = XLSX.utils.encode_cell({ r: R, c: C });
        if (!ws[cellAddress]) continue;
        if (!ws[cellAddress].s) ws[cellAddress].s = {};
        ws[cellAddress].s.alignment = { horizontal: 'left' };
    }
}
```

**Before:**
```
          Voice Quality          59.30
         Pitch Mean           993.21
```

**After:**
```
Voice Quality    59.30
Pitch Mean       993.21
```

Much cleaner and professional appearance!
