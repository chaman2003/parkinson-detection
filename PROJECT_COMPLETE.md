- **Installable**: Full PWA with home screen installation
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

## 🚀 Current Status

### Servers Running:
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:8080` ✅
- **Backend**: `http://localhost:5000` ✅

### Testing Ready:
- **Desktop browsers**: Full functionality except motion sensors
- **Mobile devices**: Complete experience with voice and motion
- **Offline mode**: Automatic fallback with service worker
- **PWA installation**: Ready for home screen installation

## 🔧 How to Use

### Quick Start:
1. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Click "Start Detection Test"**
3. **Grant microphone permission** when prompted
4. **Record your voice** for 10 seconds (say anything clearly)
5. **Hold your phone steady** for the tremor test (15 seconds)
6. **View your results** with detailed analysis

### Mobile Testing:
1. **Access via mobile browser** (Chrome/Safari recommended)
2. **Grant all permissions** (microphone, motion)
3. **Install as PWA** using browser install prompt
4. **Test offline functionality** by disconnecting internet

## 📱 PWA Features

### Installation:
- **Chrome/Edge**: Click install button in address bar
- **Safari**: Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android**: Install banner appears automatically

### Offline Support:
- **Service worker** caches app files
- **Demo mode** works without backend
- **Graceful degradation** when offline
- **Background sync** when connection restored

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

### Modern Design:
- **Gradient backgrounds** and smooth animations
- **Card-based layout** with rounded corners and shadows
- **Color-coded results** (green for normal, orange for attention)
- **Progress indicators** and loading animations
- **Mobile-friendly** touch targets and gestures

### Interactive Elements:
- **Audio visualization** during voice recording
- **Motion feedback** during tremor tests
- **Confidence bars** with smooth animations
- **Feature breakdown** with visual indicators
- **Social sharing** capabilities

## 🤖 ML Pipeline Details

### Voice Analysis:
- **Feature extraction**: 60+ voice features including MFCC, spectral characteristics
- **Quality assessment**: Audio duration, clarity, noise levels
- **Pattern recognition**: Speech rhythm, vocal tremor, stability metrics

### Tremor Analysis:
- **Motion processing**: 72+ motion features from accelerometer/gyroscope
- **Frequency analysis**: Focus on 3-12 Hz tremor range
- **Statistical analysis**: Variability, stability, pattern detection

### Ensemble Prediction:
- **Weighted combination**: 60% voice, 40% tremor
- **Confidence scoring**: Individual and overall confidence metrics
- **Feature importance**: Breakdown of key indicators
