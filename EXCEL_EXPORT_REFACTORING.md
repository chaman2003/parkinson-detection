# Excel Export Refactoring - Complete

## Changes Applied ✅

### 1. Removed Tremor Type Columns
**Before:** Excel had columns for:
- `rest_tremor` (binary)
- `postural_tremor` (binary)  
- `kinetic_tremor` (binary)

**After:** These columns have been completely removed from the export.

---

### 2. Transposed to Row-Wise Format
**Before:** Data was in column-based format (headers in first row, values in second row)

**After:** Data is now in row-wise format where each row contains:
- Row 1: Category/Feature Name
- Row 2: Value

**Example (Voice Features):**
```
VOICE FEATURES
Pitch Mean                    | 125.50 Hz
Pitch Std Dev                 | 15.23 Hz
Jitter Local                  | 0.0045
Shimmer Local                 | 0.0234
HNR Mean                      | 18.50 dB
...
```

**Example (Tremor Features):**
```
ACCELERATION FEATURES
Magnitude Mean                | 9.8123 m/s²
Magnitude Std Dev             | 0.4521 m/s²
Magnitude RMS                 | 9.8234 m/s²
...
```

This format is easier to read and analyze in Excel.

### 3. Removed Raw Motion Data Sheet
**Before:** Excel file contained a "Raw Motion Data" sheet with thousands of rows of:
- Timestamp
- Acceleration X, Y, Z
- Magnitude
- Rotation Alpha, Beta, Gamma
- Interval

**After:** Raw Motion Data sheet has been completely removed. The detailed analysis now only contains:
- Summary sheet
- Voice Features sheet (if voice test)
- Tremor Features sheet (if tremor test)

This significantly reduces file size and focuses on the analyzed features rather than raw sensor dumps.

---

### 4. Fixed Voice Test Linking
**Before:** Voice features were not properly linked to analysis results in the Excel file

**After:** Voice Features sheet now includes:
- **ANALYSIS RESULTS** section at the top:
  - Prediction
  - Voice Confidence
  - Voice Patterns
- **AUDIO METADATA** section:
  - Audio Duration (FIXED)
  - Sample Rate
  - Test ID
  - Timestamp
- **VOICE FEATURES** section with all extracted features

All data is now properly linked and contextual.

---

### 5. Fixed Audio Duration Bug
**Problem:** Audio duration was showing as 0 or incorrect values in Excel exports

**Root Cause:** The `prepareVoiceData()` function wasn't extracting duration from the backend response

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// OLD - missing duration
return {
    pitch_mean: audioFeatures.pitch_mean || 0,
    pitch_std: audioFeatures.pitch_std || 0,
    // ... no duration field
};

// NEW - includes duration and sample_rate
return {
    duration: metadata.audio_duration || audioFeatures.duration || 0,
    sample_rate: audioFeatures.sample_rate || metadata.sample_rate || 22050,
    pitch_mean: audioFeatures.pitch_mean || 0,
    pitch_std: audioFeatures.pitch_std || 0,
    // ... properly mapped features
};
```

Now audio duration correctly shows the actual recording length (e.g., "3.45 seconds")

## File Structure Changes

### Voice Test Excel:
```
Sheet 1: Summary
  - Test Information (ID, timestamp, mode)
  - Analysis Results (prediction, confidence)
  - Metadata (processing time, audio duration)

Sheet 2: Voice Features (ROW-WISE)
  - ANALYSIS RESULTS (linked prediction & confidence)
  - AUDIO METADATA (duration, sample rate, timestamps)
  - VOICE FEATURES (all extracted features)
  - DISCLAIMER
```

### Tremor Test Excel:
```
Sheet 1: Summary
  - Test Information (ID, timestamp, mode)
  - Analysis Results (prediction, confidence)
  - Metadata (processing time, motion samples)

Sheet 2: Tremor Features (ROW-WISE)
  - ANALYSIS RESULTS (linked prediction & confidence)
  - TEST METADATA (timestamps, sample count, sample rate)
  - PATTERN FEATURES (tremor frequency, stability, variability)
  - ACCELERATION FEATURES (12 features)
  - FREQUENCY FEATURES (8 features)
  - TIME DOMAIN FEATURES (4 features)
  - STABILITY METRICS (3 features)
  - DISCLAIMER
  
  ❌ NO MORE: Rest/Postural/Kinetic Tremor columns
  ❌ NO MORE: Raw Motion Data sheet
```

### Combined Test Excel:
```
Sheet 1: Summary
  - Full test information for both modes

Sheet 2: Voice Features
  - Complete voice analysis (row-wise)

Sheet 3: Tremor Features
  - Complete tremor analysis (row-wise, no tremor types)
```
