# Data Accuracy Enhancement Plan for Parkinson's Detection PWA

## Current Data Processing Pipeline Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Data Validation & Preprocessing**

#### Audio Data Accuracy:
- ✅ Implement robust audio validation (format, duration, quality)
- ✅ Advanced noise reduction and signal preprocessing
- ✅ Automatic gain control for consistent signal levels
- ✅ Voice activity detection to remove silence/artifacts
- ✅ Sample rate normalization (22.05 kHz standard)

#### Motion Data Accuracy:
- ✅ High-precision sensor data collection (100Hz sampling)
- ✅ Gravity compensation for acceleration data
- ✅ Sensor fusion for improved accuracy
- ✅ Outlier detection and removal
- ✅ Temporal synchronization validation

### 2. **Feature Extraction Enhancements**

#### Voice Features (60+ features):
- ✅ MFCC coefficients (13-39 features)
- ✅ Spectral features (centroid, rolloff, bandwidth, contrast)
- ✅ Prosodic features (pitch, formants, jitter, shimmer)
- ✅ Voice quality metrics (harmonics-to-noise ratio)
- ✅ Temporal dynamics (speaking rate, pause patterns)

#### Motion Features (72+ features):
- ✅ Time domain statistics (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis)
- ✅ Frequency domain analysis (3-12 Hz tremor band)
- ✅ Cross-correlation between axes
- ✅ Complexity measures (entropy, fractal dimension)
- ✅ Tremor-specific metrics (dominant frequency, power)

### 3. **Machine Learning Model Accuracy**

#### Ensemble Approach:
- ✅ Random Forest (handles non-linear patterns)
- ✅ Support Vector Machine (robust to outliers)
- ✅ XGBoost (gradient boosting for accuracy)
- ✅ Feature importance ranking
- ✅ Cross-validation for reliability

### 4. **Data Quality Assurance**

#### Real-time Validation:
- ✅ Input data range checking
- ✅ Missing value detection and handling
- ✅ Signal quality assessment
- ✅ Temporal consistency validation
- ✅ Statistical outlier detection

#### Error Handling:
- ✅ Graceful degradation for poor quality data
- ✅ Confidence scoring based on data quality
- ✅ Alternative feature sets for low-quality inputs
- ✅ User feedback on data collection quality

### 5. **Scientific Validation**

#### Research-Based Parameters:
- ✅ Tremor frequency range: 3-12 Hz (Parkinson's specific)
- ✅ Voice analysis parameters based on medical literature
- ✅ Feature normalization using clinical standards
- ✅ Threshold values from peer-reviewed research
