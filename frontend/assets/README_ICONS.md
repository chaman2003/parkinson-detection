# Icon Placeholder File
# 
# This file contains base64 encoded placeholder icons for the PWA.
# In a production app, you would replace these with actual PNG files.
# 
# To create proper icons:
# 1. Design a 512x512 icon for your app
# 2. Generate different sizes (72, 96, 128, 144, 152, 192, 384, 512)
# 3. Save as PNG files in the assets folder
# 4. Update the manifest.json file paths accordingly
#
# For now, the app will work without the icon files, but the PWA install
# prompt may not appear on some devices.
#
# Recommended icon design:
# - Simple, clean design
# - Medical/health theme
# - Brain or neuron iconography
# - Blue/teal color scheme matching the app
